# Welcome to Motio!

## What is Motio?
Motio is a drive safety app that uses the cellphone accelerometer and location data during drives to catch reckless driving or driving faults. Extra analysis is also provided at the end for context clues as to reasons why some events could have occurred.
Users are also able to add friends, which they can then see each other's drive stats and previous drives, as well as compete with them to get better scores.

Motio is built using Firebase, Expo/React-Native, FastAPI, ChatGPT API, OpenMeteo API, and the Overpass API.
